v1.0.0
======

## New features

- The [OpenCloud adapter](https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette/blob/v0.5.0/src/Gaufrette/Adapter/OpenCloud.php)
has been replaced by the [OpenStack adapter](/src/Gaufrette/Adapter/OpenStack.php).
The new adapter now uses the https://github.com/php-opencloud/openstack SDK
which is the latest supported version of the SDK for OpenStack instead of
https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud (#533).
- Google Cloud Storage Adapter (#557)

## Removed (introduces BC breaks)

- The [OpenCloud adapter](https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette/blob/v0.5.0/src/Gaufrette/Adapter/OpenCloud.php)
has been removed.
- The [ObjectStoreFactory](https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette/blob/v0.5.0/src/Gaufrette/Adapter/OpenStackCloudFiles/ObjectStoreFactory.php)
has been removed.

## Changes (introduces BC breaks)

should be done prior to any adapter usage (#618).
