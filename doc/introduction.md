# Gaufrette

Gaufrette provides a filesystem abstraction layer.

## Why use Gaufrette?

Imagine you have to manage a lot of medias in a PHP project. Lets see how to
take this situation in your advantage using Gaufrette.

The filesystem abstraction layer permits you to develop your application without
the need to know were all those medias will be stored and how.

Another advantage of this is the possibility to update the files location
without any impact on the code apart from the definition of your filesystem.
In example, if your project grows up very fast and if your server reaches its
limits, you can easily move your medias in an Amazon S3 server or any other
solution.
